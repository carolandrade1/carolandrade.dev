## My personal website and portfolio.

- Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [React](https://reactjs.org), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- Animated with [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion)
- Styled with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)
- Hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

## TODO
This portfolio is using the beta version of Next.js 13, so there are some things that I still need to learn or some tools that they haven't launched yet.

- [ ] Global `404` page
- [X] Use a database instead of the info file that I have
- [X] Study more about typescript
- [X] Create more animations and search about accessibility
- [X] Add article section with references
- [ ] Create a guestbook

## Old portfolio
The main reason that I am doing it all over again, is that I realize (way too late) that maintaining and updating a project can be a little demanding sometimes.
<br>You can check out my [old portfolio here](https://carol-portfolio.vercel.app).

## Design references
My idea was to create a page that resembles [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). But I also use other portfolios as a reference.
